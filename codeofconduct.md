## Code Of Conduct

Like the tech community as a whole, the ABES Technovation team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers
working on every aspect of the mission – including mentorship, teaching and organizing events.
Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground
rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to all those participating in our events (organisers, mentors, judges, 
sponsors, facilitators and attendees).

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended – a guide to make it 
easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all events managed by the ABES Technovation team. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces
may affect a person’s ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing technovation@abes.ac.in or directly, 
by engaging with the Club Head.

### Be friendly and patient

### Be welcoming
  We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to 
  members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, 
  sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
  
### Be considerate
-  Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect colleagues 
   and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a community, so you might not 
   be communicating in someone else’s primary language.  
   
### Be respectful
-  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some 
   frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community 
   where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the ABES Technovation community should be respectful when 
   dealing with other members as well as with people outside the ABES Technovation community.
   
### Be careful in the words that you choose
-  We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other 
   participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
   - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
   - Discriminatory jokes and language.
   - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
   - Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information.
   - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
   - Unwelcome sexual attention.
   - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
   - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
   
### Report violation of the code of conduct
-   If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing at technovation@abes.ac.in or directly, by reporting to the Club Head.

### Processing Code of Conduct Violations
-   The complaint/incident report will be reviewed and the member named in the complaint will be notified. Both the members will be interviewed by the club head and on the basis of provided proofs suitable actions will be taken against the member who violated the code of conduct.
  
### Actions against violation of the code of conduct
-   The following actions may be taken against the members who violate the code of conduct:
    -   Losing all access to Club facilities, equipment, programs and other privileges for a defined period of time.
    -   Loss of all privileges to participate in Club events or events utilizing Club resources for a defined period of time.
    -   Loss of privilege to use the Club’s name.
    -   Termination from Club.
